Included are the jupyter notebooks used to explore and visualize/manipulate the data as well as the final preprocessing script. I used Scikit-Learn Models like Random Forest Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, and Logistic Regression, combined with GridSearchCV to optimize the parameters for these models. My highest accuracy was achieved with the SGDClassifier, which classified passengers with an accuracy of 78%, placing it in the top 20% of submitted solutions.
